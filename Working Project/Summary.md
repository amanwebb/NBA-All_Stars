## Summary and Final Thoughts

This code is to help predict NBA All-Stars based on player statistics alone. I have been able to get a pretty good accuracy with my predictions, as my 2022 predictions come out with 89% of my selections actually being All-Stars. That is extremely good! We do not want it to be too high, because then we have to deal with the potential issue of overfitting and other problems. 

One thing that I also need to look into a little more - my predictions only outputted 18 picks. There are a total of 26 players selected, so I need to adjust the code to include a few more players. This could change the accuracy score a little bit in either direction. 

I still need to adjust my code to pick a specific number of players from each conference, as well as including starters and bench. This was the entire purpose of this project - to see whether or not Luka should be a starter or a bench player. That is what I will work on in the near future. I will keep you all updated as I progress in this endeavor. 

I have a lot of work to do if I want to make this prediction model even better and up to what I actually want. It is very good as is, but a lot of work is still needed to be done.
