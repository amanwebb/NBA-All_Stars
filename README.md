# NBA All-Star Predictions
## Introduction

Because Luka Doncic was snubbed from being listed as a starter this year (2021-2022), I wanted to see if he actually should be or if it is just my fandom that says he should.

Every year the NBA selects 24 of its star players to play in an exhibition "All-Star" game. This game is usually held in the middle of the season and is one of the most anticipated events of the year, serving as the marquee event of the otherwise uniform middle part of the season. 

Being selected as an All-Star is considered a very high honor, and the number of All-Star selections a player has is often one of the first statistics cited to demonstrate a player's greatness.

This project aims to answer the question of if player data can be used to predict who will be selected as an All-Star. It will do so by being trained on data from the 2016-2022 seasons and then making predictions for the 2022 season All-Star game. This will shed light on how predictive the data is for All-Star selctions, what factors matter most, and what players, if any, were snubbed in the 2022 season according to historical data.

I have a lot to do still with this to make it perfect, but it gives a good start on predicting these All-Stars based on in-game stats alone. I know that there are other factors like popularity and such, but I want to knwo who the statistical All-Stars are. Included in this code are basic stats like Games Startedd, Free throws, and Personal Fouls to name a few. I feel like this gives a good starting point to my quest of identifying the true statistical All-Stars.

One last thing I would like to point out would be that I do not yet have a part of the code where it differentiates Starters from Reserves. That is my next step, as that is what my primary goal was starting this project.

## Summary and Final Thoughts

This code is to help predict NBA All-Stars based on player statistics alone. I have been able to get a pretty good accuracy with my predictions, as my 2022 predictions come out with 89% of my selections actually being All-Stars. That is extremely good! We do not want it to be too high, because then we have to deal with the potential issue of overfitting and other problems. 

One thing that I also need to look into a little more - my predictions only outputted 18 picks. There are a total of 24 players selected, so I need to adjust the code to include a few more players. This could change the accuracy score a little bit either direction. 

I still need to adjust my code to pick a specific number of players from each conference, as well as including starters and bench. This was the entire purpose of this project - to see whether or not Luka should be a starter or a bench player. That is what I will work on in the near future. I will keep you all updated as I progress in this endeavor. 

I have a lot of work to do if I want to make this prediction model even better and up to what I actually want. It is very good as is, but a lot of work is still needed to be done.
