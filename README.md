Predict and compare NBA All-Stars

Because Luka Doncic was snubbed from being listed as a starter this year (2021-2022), I wanted to see if he actually should be, or if it is just my fandom that says he should.

I have a lot to do still with this to make it perfect, but it gives a good start on predicting these All-Stars based on in-game stats alone. I know that there are other factors like popularity and such, but I want to knwo who the statistical All-Stars are. Included in this code are basic stats like Games Startedd, Free throws, and Personal Fouls to name a few. I feel like this gives a good starting point to my quest of identifying the true statistical All-Stars.

This code also includes web scraping. Due to the nature of websites changing their format and such, this code may not work. The last edit was February 7, 2022. As of this day, the code still scrapes correctly.
